# Use an Event Listener in a Component

Render functions often contain event listeners. Hereâ€™s an example of an event listener in a render function:

```
render() {
  return (
    <div onHover={myFunc}>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Recall that an event *handler* is a function that gets called in response to an event. In the above example, the event handler is `myFunc()`.

In React, you define event handlers as methods on a component class. Like this:

```
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  myFunc() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div onHover={this.myFunc}>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice that the component class has two methods: `.myFunc()` and `.render()`. `.myFunc()` is being used as an event handler. `.myFunc()` will be called any time that a user hovers over the rendered `<div></div>`
