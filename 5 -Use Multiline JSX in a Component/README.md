# Use Multiline JSX in a Component

In this lesson, you will learn some common ways that JSX and React components work together. Youâ€™ll get more comfortable with both JSX and components, while picking up some new tricks.

Take a look at this HTML:

```
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The world is full of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.
  </p>
  <cite>
    <a target="_blank"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Huebler">
      Douglas Huebler
    </a>
  </cite>
</blockquote>
```

How might you make a React component that renders this HTML?
