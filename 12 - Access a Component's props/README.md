# Access a Component's props

Every component has something called `props`.

A component’s `props` is an object. It holds information about that component.

To see a component’s `props` object, you use the expression `this.props`. Here’s an example of `this.props` being used inside of a render method:

```
render() {
  console.log("Props object comin' up!");

  console.log(this.props);

  console.log("That was my props object!");

  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}
```

Most of the information in `this.props` is pretty useless! But some of it is extremely important, as you’ll see.
