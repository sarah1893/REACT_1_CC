# Render Different UI Based on props

Awesome! You passed a prop from a component to a different component, accessed that prop from the receiver component, and rendered it!

You can do more with ``props`` than just display them. You can also use ``props`` to make decisions.

In the code editor, look at the ``Welcome`` component class.

You can tell from ``this.props.name`` on line 5 that ``Welcome`` expects to receive a piece of information called *name*. However, ``Welcome`` never renders this piece of information! Instead, it uses the information to make a decision.

``<Welcome />`` instances will render the text `WELCOME "2" MY WEB SITE BABYYY!!!!!`, unless the user is Mozart, in which case they will render the more respectful `hello sir it is truly great to meet you here on the web`.

The passed-in *name* is not displayed in either case! The name is used to *decide* what will be displayed. This is a common technique.

Select **Home.js** and look at the ``Home`` component class. What will ``<Welcome />`` render to the screen?
